### Bug Fixes

* Improved collection handling and type casting

* The sdk is ported to a es6 and is transpiled with babel to es5. But there are no breaking API changes therefore you can silently upgrade in most cases.
* If you like to use the es6 code base and want to transpile the es6 code by yourself, require the lib/baqend.js directly.

### Breaking changes

* DB.List is now a native Array
 * therefore the `new Array(<iterable>)` constructor is gone and should be replaced with `Array.from(<iterable>)`
 * list.get/add/delete/size must be replaced by the corresponding native array functions and you can use the index based access of lists, i.e. `list[0] = 'val'`
