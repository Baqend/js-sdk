### Braking Changes

* `File.url -> string` was removed and replaced with an asynchronous implementation `file.createURL() -> Promise<string>` This Change was necessary by migration from cryptojs dependency to the native implementation of Browser/Node APIs. 
* To reduce the overall package size, all Shims are not bundled and shipped anymore. Adding a Promise shim on old Browsers must be done manually now
* If you have previously relied on the global DB variable, you must expose the global DB variable manually now. Consult the README for required migration steps.

 * therefore the `new Array(<iterable>)` constructor is gone and should be replaced with `Array.from(<iterable>)`
 * list.get/add/delete/size must be replaced by the corresponding native array functions and you can use the index based access of lists, i.e. `list[0] = 'val'`
